All fields have to be declared textually within the source of their outer features.
Field declared: '[36mf =.x[39m'
To fix this, you could move the declaration into the implementation of feature '[36mf =[39m'.  Alternatively, you can declare a routine instead.

Type '[33mf =[39m' was not found, no corresponding feature nor formal generic argument exists
Type that was not found: '[33mf =[39m'
in feature: '[35m#universe[39m'
within feature: '[35mex90illegal[39m'
To solve this, check the spelling of the type you have used.

Fuzion currently does not know when to execute this initializer, so it is forbidden.
To solve this, move the declaration inside another feature or ask the Fuzion team for help.
