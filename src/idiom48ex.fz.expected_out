Strings extending over several lines are currenlty not well supported
in Fuzion.  They can be constructed out of several shorter strings
that are concatenated using 'infix +'.  Line feeds are inserted using
a backslash followed by an 'n', i.e, '\n'.  Additionally, the string
has to be enclosed in parentheses since operator expressions are
limited to one line.
